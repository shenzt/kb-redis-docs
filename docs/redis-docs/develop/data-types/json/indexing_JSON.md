In addition to storing JSON documents, you can also index them using the [Redis Query Engine]({{< relref "/develop/ai/search-and-query/" >}}) feature. This enables full-text search capabilities and document retrieval based on their content.

To use these features, install [Redis Open Source]({{< relref "/operate/oss_and_stack/" >}}).

See the [tutorial]({{< relref "/develop/ai/search-and-query/indexing/" >}}) to learn how to search and query your JSON.
